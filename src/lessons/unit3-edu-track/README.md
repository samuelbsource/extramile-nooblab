# README - Advanced Java Programming with Object-Oriented Concepts

## Overview

This project is a virtual learning environment designed to enhance students' understanding of Java programming through practical, structured exercises. Built using special HTML syntax, hosted on GitHub Pages, and available through **NoobLab**, this course guides students through iterative development, from procedural programming to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Course Development

The lesson plan follows a structured approach where students:

1. **Reinforce Java Fundamentals** – Refresh their knowledge of Java syntax, variables, methods, and input handling.
2. **Build a Procedural Application** – Develop a menu-driven terminal application for managing student records.
3. **Transition to OOP** – Introduce classes, objects, and structured application development to improve maintainability and scalability.
4. **Enhance Features** – Implement filtering, validation, and additional functionality to simulate real-world application scenarios.
5. **Expand with Additional Practice** – Extend functionality by adding course management features and student-course assignments.

## Key Learning Points

- Understanding the evolution from procedural to object-oriented programming.
- Implementing CRUD operations using Java.
- Using collections (`List<Student>`) for better data management.
- Designing maintainable and scalable applications using OOP principles.
