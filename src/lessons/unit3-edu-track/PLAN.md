**Lesson Plan: Advanced Java Programming with Object-Oriented Concepts**

Many students already have a fundamental understanding of Java. This course is designed for those who want to take their knowledge further by applying concepts in a structured, practical way. The focus is on reinforcing Java skills while showing how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) improves the organization and maintainability of real-world applications. By the end of the lesson, students will have built a fully functional terminal-based CRUD application to manage student records, evolving from a procedural approach to a well-structured OOP design.

### **Lesson Objectives**

1. Expand on Java programming concepts students are already familiar with, reinforcing and deepening their understanding.
2. Guide students in developing a terminal-based application iteratively.
3. Demonstrate the advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for better application structure and maintainability.
4. Implement a memory-based CRUD system to manage student records.

### **Lesson Structure**

#### **1. Java Basics Refresher**

- Reinforce Java syntax, variables, data types, and control flow.
- Review methods and basic input/output operations using `Scanner`.
- Write a simple program to accept user input and print responses.

#### **2. Building a Procedural Terminal Application**

- Develop a simple menu-driven console application.
- Implement options to:
  - Add a student.
  - View all students.
  - Edit student details.
  - Delete a student.
  - Exit the program.
- Store student data in a basic array before transitioning to `List<Student>` for better flexibility.
- Discuss the drawbacks of procedural code, such as code repetition and difficulty in scaling.

#### **3. Transitioning to Object-Oriented Programming**

- Reiterate what classes and objects are, ensuring students understand their role in structuring applications.
- Refactor the application:
  - Create a `Student` class with attributes like `id`, `name`, `age`, etc.
  - Use a `List<Student>` to manage students instead of raw data structures.
  - Implement methods for CRUD operations inside a `StudentManager` class.
- Discuss how OOP improves maintainability, readability, and scalability.

#### **4. Enhancing the Application**

- Implement filtering options (e.g., filter by age, name search).
- Add validation checks for inputs.
- Discuss potential improvements (e.g., persistence using files or databases).

### **Final Discussion and Reflection**

- Summarize key takeaways: Java syntax, procedural vs. OOP design, CRUD operations.
- Provide additional resources and encourage self-assessment through guided reflection questions.

### **Additional Practice Tasks**

- Allow users to add courses to the program and assign students to courses.
- Modify the application to include additional attributes like student grades or predicted exam results.
- Implement a sorting feature (e.g., sort students by name or age).

Encourage students to apply their knowledge through hands-on practice, reinforcing key concepts while identifying and addressing any gaps in their understanding.
