    <h2 class="title">Welcome to this challange</h2>
    <p>
        This challange is designed for students who want to deepen their understanding of programming concepts. It goes beyond the basics to provide a structured yet flexible learning experience.<br /><br />
        The focus is on transitioning from procedural programming to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), helping you see how structured approaches can improve the organization and maintainability of your code.<br /><br />
        There are no strict tests or assessments, but you are encouraged to experiment, tweak the code, and explore different ways to approach the exercises. The best way to learn is through hands-on practice.<br /><br />
        Feel free to explore, make changes, and test your understanding!

        During this challange, we will build a terminal-based application step by step. Initially, we will implement a simple menu-driven system to manage student records using a procedural approach. As we progress, we will refactor the code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to improve maintainability and scalability. By the end of the lesson, you will have a well-structured student management system capable of adding, editing, deleting, and filtering student records.
