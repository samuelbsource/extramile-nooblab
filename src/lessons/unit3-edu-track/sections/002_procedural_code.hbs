    <h2 class="title">Implementing the Application in the Main Class</h2>
    <p>
        In this section, you will implement the entire application inside the <code>Main</code> class, without creating additional objects.<br>
        The goal is to understand the challenges of procedural programming before transitioning to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

    <p>
        We want to create something that looks like the following:<br>
        You can guess the behaviour, or implement something different, there are no negative points for guessing badly!<br>

        You can start with the following code, it's just a simple program that prints "Hello World" and imports Scanner class that we will need later, it's a good starting point.
    </p>
    {{{ insertBundle "starter" }}}

        I encourage you to think how you can solve this problem yourself.<br>
        Open notepad, and note down individual steps.<br><br>

        I have written down some user stories below.<br>
        You can think of a user story as a <strong>test case</strong> that would involve a real user.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Story #1</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> View the menu displayed on the screen.<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can easily see the available options.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #2</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> Input an option using my keyboard to select a menu item.<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can navigate to different sections of the application.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #3</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> Return to the Main Menu after completing a task.<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can choose another action without restarting the application.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #4</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> See the menu to add new student data when I input "1".<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can register a new student in the system.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #5</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> See a list of all students in the system when I input "2".<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can review the student records.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #6</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> See a list of students with an option to select one for editing when I input "3".<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can modify a student’s details if needed.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #7</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> Be prompted to enter new details when editing a student’s information.<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can either update the information or leave fields blank to retain existing values.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #8</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> See a list of students with an option to select one for deletion when I input "4".<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can remove a student’s data from the system if needed.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Story #9</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>As:</strong> a user,<br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> Exit the program when I input "5".<br>
        <strong>So that:</strong> I can close the application when I’m done using it.
