    <h2 class="title">Implementing the Application in the Main Class</h2>
    <p>
        In this section, you will implement the entire application inside the <code>Main</code> class, without creating additional objects.<br>
        The goal is to understand the challenges of procedural programming before transitioning to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

        We want to create something that looks like the following:<br>
        You can guess the behaviour, or implement something different, there are no negative points for guessing badly!<br>

        You can start with the following code, it's just a simple program that prints "Hello World" and imports Scanner class that we will need later, it's a good starting point.
    </p>
    {{{ insertBundle "starter" }}}

    <p>
        Feel free to following the given steps below, they are meant to give you an idea, but feel free to implement it by yourself if you are feeling up to task.
    </p>

    <h3>Task #1</h3>
    <p>
        Create a program that generates basic "Main Menu" just as shown above.<br>
        For now, just that, make it display the menu.
    </p>

    <h3>Task #2</h3>
    <p>
        Allow the program to take option from the user.<br>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> You might need to create an INSTANCE of the <code>Scanner</code> class.<br>
        For now, just take input from the user, don't need to actually process it any way, but you can if you want.
    </p>

    <h3>Task #3</h3>
    <p>
        Allow the program to continuously accept the input from the user.<br>
        It does not matter what they input, it should just print the menu again and accept option again.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Create a new instance of the <code>Scanner</code> class. You will need this later for accepting input.<br>
    </h3>
