    <h1>Extra mile for extra hard working students</h1>

    <div class="section" id="introduction">
        <h2 class="title">About these exercises</h2>
        <p>
            These exercises are for students who want to go the extra mile.
            They are not part of the course, but are available for students who want to learn more.<br /><br />
            There are no medals I am not going to test you on these exercises, but I will be happy to help you if you get stuck.<br /><br />
            I belive the best way to learn is to play around with the code rather than following strict instructions.<br /><br />
            Feel free to play around and experiment with the code.
        </p>
        <h3>What are we doing to do here</h3>
        <p>
            In this exercise, we are going to create a simple "database" program in Java.
            The problem will display a menu, asking the user to choose an option.
            The user can add a new Student to the database, list all students in the database, advance all students to the next year, or exit the program.
            Maybe I will add more options if I can come up with some ideas.
        </p>

        <h3>What you need to know</h3>
        <p>
            I am assuming that you already know how to do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>How to use a <code>Scanner</code> to read input from the user</li>
                <li>How to use a loop to repeat a block of code</li>
                <li>How to use an if statement to make a decision</li>
                <li>How to create a class in Java</li>
                <li>How to create an object of a class</li>
                <li>How to call a method on an object</li>
            </ul>

            You might not know how to create an array in Java, but I will show you how to do that.
        </p>

        <h3>Terminology I am going to use</h3>
        <p>
            Since it might not be clear how things are referred to in Object Oriented Programming, and I am not sure if Paul is going to teach you this,
            I am going to use the following OOP terminology:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Property</b>: A property is a variable that is part of a class. For example, a <code>Student</code> class might have a property called <code>name</code>.</li>
                <li><b>Method</b>: A method is a function that is part of a class. For example, a <code>Student</code> class might have a method called <code>advanceYear</code>.</li>
                <li><b>Parameter</b>: A parameter is a variable that is passed to a method. For example, <code>setName</code> might take a parameter called <code>name</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            This is not a definitive or strict definition, but it should help you understand what I am talking about.
            Some developers are referring to properties as fields <b>¯\(°_o)/¯</b> ... this is fine actually, you can use either term.
        </p>

        <h3>That takes me to:</h3>
        <h4>Variable scope</h4>
        <p>
            The scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is accessible.
            In Java, there are three levels of scope:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Class level</b>: A variable that is defined at the class level is accessible from anywhere within the class - it is called a <b>property</b> of that class.</li>
                <li><b>Method level</b>: A variable that is defined within a method is only accessible within that method.</li>
                <li><b>Block level</b>: A variable that is defined within a block of code is only accessible within that block of code. (<i>this is not relevant for this exercise</i>)</li>
            </ul>

            To illustrate this, consider the following code:
        <div class="codebundle" style="margin-top: 1em; position: relative; cursor: pointer;">
            <pre class="codefile" data-filename="Main.java" style="display: none;">public class Main
{
    // This is a property
    public static String name;

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // This is a method level variable
        String localName = "Alice";

        // This is a block level variable
        if (true) {
            String blockName = "Bob";
        }

        // This is a property
        name = "Charlie";

        // This works
        System.out.println(localName);

        // This works
        System.out.println(name);

        // This does not work
        System.out.println(blockName);

        printName();
    }

    public static void printName()
    {
        // This works
        System.out.println(name);

        // This does not work
        System.out.println(localName);

        // This does not work
        System.out.println(blockName);
    }
}</pre></div>
        </p>

        <h2>One more thing</h2>
        <p>
            You can use static on a property in Java just like you can use static on a method.
            A static property is bound to the class, not to an object of the class, you don't need to create an object to access a static property.

            Have a look at the following code to see what I mean:
        </p>

        <div class="codebundle" style="margin-top: 1em; position: relative; cursor: pointer;">
<pre class="codefile" data-filename="Main.java" style="display: none;">public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Accessing a static property
        System.out.println("Number of students: " + Student.studentCount);
        
        Student student1 = new Student("Alice");
        Student student2 = new Student("Bob");
        
        // Accesing a static property
        System.out.println("Number of students: " + Student.studentCount);

        // This works
        System.out.println("Student 1 name: " + student1.name);

        // This does not work
        System.out.println(Student.name);

        // You can do this, but it will cause the program to run in an infinite loop
        Main.main(args);
    }
}</pre>
<pre class="codefile" data-filename="Student.java" style="display: none;">public class Student
{
    // This is a static property
    public static int studentCount = 0;
    public String name;

    public Student(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
        Student.studentCount++;
    }
}</pre></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="menu-in-java">
        <h2 class="title">Building a menu in Java</h2>

        <p>
            Start with the following code bundle:
        </p>

        <div class="codebundle" style="margin-top: 1em; position: relative; cursor: pointer;">
            <pre class="codefile" data-filename="Main.java" style="display: none;">import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}</pre></div>

        <p>
            You should probably run the program to make sure it runs.
        </p>

        <h3>The plan</h3>
        <h4>Planning the functionality</h4>
        <p>
            The plan is to create a menu that looks like this:
<pre>==== Menu ====
1. Add student
2. List students
3. Advance year
4. Exit</pre>

            The program will display the menu, and then ask the user to choose an option.
            Depending on the option chosen, the program will run different method.
            One of the methods will ask the user to input student data,<br>
            another method will list all students in the database,<br>
            the third method will advance all students to the next year,<br>
            Lastly, the fourth method will exit the program.
        </p>

        <h4>Planning the <code>Main</code> code</h4>
        <p>
            We are going to create a few convenience methods.
            It's generally a good idea separate your code into small pieces that do one thing, instead of having one big block of code that does everything.
            This makes your code easier to read and maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I was writing the code, I would create the following static methods in my <code>Main</code> class.
            <ul>
                <li><code>printMenu()</code></li>
                <li><code>takeOption()</code></li>
                <li><code>inputStudent()</code></li>
                <li><code>printStudents()</code></li>
                <li><code>advanceYears()</code></li>
            </ul>

            For now, these do nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I would also add a static method called <code>scanner</code> to the <code>Main</code> class.
            This would ensure that I only have to create one <code>Scanner</code> and allow me to reuse it across all my static methods.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I would create the simplest implementation I can think of for these methods.<br>
            So that: <br>
            The <code>printMenu()</code> actually prints the menu (easy!).<br>
            The <code>takeOption()</code> method asks the user for a single int value.<br>
            The <code>inputStudent()</code> method asks user for an input in sequence, but does not do anything with it.<br>
            <code>printStudents()</code> just displays "Work in progress" and <br>
            <code>advanceYears()</code> does nothing.

            And I would create an infinite loop in my <code>main</code> method, it would call the <code>printMenu</code> and <code>takeOption()</code> methods, and depending on the options selected call one of the other methods.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
            It would result in the following code:<br><br>

            WARNING: Only press on the bundle if you are struggling and can't progress.<br>
            It is really much better if you try to figure this thing on your own.<br>
            What is the point of doing these exercises otherwise?<br>
